# Space-Wars
Space Wars is my first game that i developed using Python.  Two people can play the game on a single keyboard, the yellow spaceship is controlled by W, A, S, D and the red spaceship is controlled by UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys.  The ships can shoot projectiles where you press LCTRL for the yellow ship and RCTRL for the red ship.  The objective of the game is to shoot down the enemy before they do the same to you.
